### RESUME 🏄‍♂️🌊🦈

There is a widespread theory about sharks which defends that they attack usually because they are confused. In fact, shark are actually shy creatures. Scientists think they mistake surfers for sea lions or other marine animals that make up their diet.

Sharks hunt and are more active at night than during the day, so the worst hours for surfing would be early morning or late afternoon, is this true?

Also, if it were, would those attacks be more likely to be fatal-ending than those that occur throughout the day?

We are going to analyze these and other things based on the seas and the sharks that record the most attacks on surfers.
